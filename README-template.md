## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about variable fonts and imported the provided variable font to use it in the CSS code to style the HTML element (I wrote an article about this some time ago and I had to refer back to it after about a year!).

Here's how I did it:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "Inter";
  src: url("./assets/fonts/Inter-VariableFont_slnt,wght.ttf");
  font-weight: 100 900;
}
```

I put the color values and the `border-radius` value in CSS variables to make them resubale.

### Continued development

In this challenge, I tried a lot to center the `<div>` vertically. But, the approaches I came across searhes didn't quite satisfy me. I wish to look more into that.
